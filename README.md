My goal is to use my knowledge of Programming and IT to start a career in the Software Engineering/Development field while continuing an education in Computer Science with a focus on Machine Learning. I am highly communicative, have knowledge of multiple programming languages such as C#, Python, C++, and look forward to any opportunity to learn more. I am most proficient in C# and have developed multiple C# apps, utilizing algorithmic knowledge, Model View Controllers, .NET 6.0 Frameworks, and SQL Databases.
